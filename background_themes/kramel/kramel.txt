Here is a color palette tailored specifically for Karmel the Cat (the Hebrew children’s book series), designed to reflect Karmel’s personality: clever, mischievous, slightly mysterious, and warm—not overly childish, but still magical and inviting.

This palette works well for book illustrations, covers, interior pages, posters, and educational material.
